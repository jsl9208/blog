Hi, I'm **Shilong Jiang**.

10-year startup CTO and full-stack engineer. Currently CTO at [Heywhale](https://www.heywhale.com), building AI-powered products and infrastructure. Deeply involved in the big data & analytics community.

This blog is where I share source code analysis, architecture breakdowns, and lessons learned from building and studying complex software systems.

## Current Focus

- **AI Agent** — exploring how LLM-powered agents can be orchestrated for real engineering work
- **AI Infra** — building the infrastructure that powers intelligent systems at scale
- **B2B ML Platforms** — designing machine learning platforms for enterprise customers
- **Cloud-Native AgentOps** — building platforms for deploying, monitoring, and operating AI agents at scale
- **Open Source** — contributing to and analyzing projects like [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode), [Kubeflow Trainer](https://github.com/kubeflow/trainer), and [HAMi](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi)
